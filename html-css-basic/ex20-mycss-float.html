  <h1>CSS Layout - float and clear</h1>
  <h2>The CSS float property specifies how an element should float</h2>
  <p>The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.</p>

  <h2>The float Property</h2>
  <p>The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a
    container.</p>

  <ol class="float-values">The float property can have one of the following values:
    <li>left - The element floats to the left of its container</li>
    <li>right - The element floats to the right of its container</li>
    <li>none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default</li>
    <li>inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.</p>

      style="width:160px;height:150px;margin-left:15px;">

    The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit, also called a pineapple, and the most
    economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.<br>
    Pineapples may be cultivated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to
    ten months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest.
    In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of
    pineapples.

    <img src="./img/pineapple3.jpg" class="image1" alt="img of a young pineapple in flower"
      style="width:170px;height:150px;margin-left:15px;">
    <br>
    The word "pineapple" in English was first recorded to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed
    pine cones). When European explorers encountered this tropical fruit in the Americas, they called them "pineapples"
    (first referenced in 1664, for resemblance to pine cones).
    In the scientific binomial Ananas comosus, ananas, the original name of the fruit, comes from the Tupi word nanas,
    meaning "excellent fruit", as recorded by André Thevet in 1555, and comosus, "tufted", refers to the stem of the
    fruit. Other members of the genus Ananas are often called pine, as well, in other languages.

    <img src="./img/pineapple4.jpg" class="image1" alt="img of pineapple in the starting stage"
      style="width:160px;height:150px;margin-left:15px;">
    <br>
    The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) tall, although sometimes it can
    be taller. In appearance, the plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves. When creating its fruit, it
    usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this. Once it flowers, the
    individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit. After the first fruit is produced, side
    shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem. These may be
    removed for propagation, or left to produce additional fruits on the original plant. Commercially, suckers that
    appear around the base are cultivated.

    <img src="./img/pineaples_plant.jpg" class="image1" alt="img of pineapple plant"
      style="width:190px;height:150px;margin-left:15px;">
    <br>
    The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and
    Paraguay; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976). MS Bertoni
    (1919)[19] considered the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus.The natives
    of southern Brazil and Paraguay spread the pineapple throughout South America, and it eventually reached the
    Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs. Columbus encountered
    the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe. He called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the
    Indians", and brought it back with him to Spain, thus making the pineapple the first bromeliad to be introduced by
    humans outside of the New World. The Spanish introduced it into the Philippines, Hawaii (introduced in the 18th
    century, first commercial plantation 1886), Zimbabwe, and Guam. The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and
    introduced it into India by 1550.

    <img src="./img/pineapples5.jpg" class="image1" alt="img of riped pineapples"
      style="width:160px;height:150px;margin-left:15px;">
    <br>
    The pineapple was brought to northern Europe by the Dutch from their colony in Surinam. The first pineapple to be
    successfully cultivated in Europe, is said to have been grown by Pieter de la Court at Meerburg in 1658.<br>
    In England, the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court, Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and a huge "pineapple stove"
    needed to grow the plants had been built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1723. In France, King Louis XV was
    presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in 1733. Catherine the Great ate pineapples grown on
    her own estates before her death in 1796. Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in
    equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using hothouses called "pineries", pineapples
    soon became a symbol of wealth. They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being
    eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot. By the second half of the 18th century, the
    production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats.
    John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola 14 metres tall in
    the shape of the fruit; it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple.

    <p style="color: black; text-indent: 18px;">
      Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a
      specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
      algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
      language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages
      that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
      processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the
      performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given
      problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including
      knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.<br>
      Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation
      of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might
      be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger
      process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software
      engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is the
      opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a
      problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.

  <h3>What does computing mean?</h3>
  <div class="div10">
    <img src="./img/technology-wallpaper1.jpg" width="500" height="300"><br>Computing Technologies!
  </div>

  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 18px;">
    Computing is any activity that uses computers to manage, process, and communicate information. It includes
    development of both hardware and software. Computing is a critical, integral component of modern industrial
    technology. Major computing disciplines include computer engineering, software engineering, computer science,
    information systems, and information technology.<br>
    In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating
    computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of
    purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using
    computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media;
    finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and
    the possibilities are vast.<br>
    However, Computing Curricula 2005 also recognizes that the meaning of "computing" depends on the context:<br>
    Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For
    example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer.
    Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do
    computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.<br>
    The term "computing" has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 ACM report on Computing as a Discipline:<br>
    The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform
    information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question
    underlying all computing is "What can be (efficiently) automated?"<br>
    The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating. In earlier times, it was used in reference to
    the action performed by mechanical computing machines, and before that, to human computers.<br>

    <img src="./img/mango.jpg" class="image2" alt="Mango" style="width:160px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;">
    Mangoes are juicy stone fruit (drupes) produced from numerous species of tropical trees belonging to the flowering
    plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for this edible fruit.<br>
    Most of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae.
    Mangoes are native to South Asia, from where the "common mango" or "Indian mango", Mangifera indica, has been
    distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics. Other Mangifera species
    (e.g. horse mango, Mangifera foetida) are grown on a more localized basis.<br>
    It is the national fruit of India and Pakistan, and the national tree of Bangladesh. It is the unofficial
    national fruit of the Philippines.<br>
    The English word "mango" (plural "mangoes" or "mangos") originated from the Malayalam word māṅṅa (or mangga) via
    Dravidian-Tamil (mankay as man for mango tree and kay for fruit, or maangaay) during the spice trade period with
    South India in the 15th and 16th centuries.<br>
    The earliest known reference to the cultivation of mangoes can be traced to India up to 2000BCE[8] Mango was brought
    to East Asia around 400–500 BCE, in the 15th century to the Philippines, and in the 16th century to Africa and
    Brazil by Portuguese explorers. There have been several verified accounts and novels with references to the mango
    fruit in Indian Tamil literary works, the most prominent known reference to the mango fruit being to the 5th century
    saint Karaikkal Ammaiyar, where it is mentioned that she received a mango fruit as a boon from Lord Shiva, due to
    her devotion when her husband requested it, after providing alms one out of two mangoes given by her husband earlier
    to a Ascetic, disguised as Lord Shiva.<br>
    Mango is mentioned by Hendrik van Rheede, the Dutch commander of the Malabar region in his 1678 book, Hortus
    Malabaricus, about plants having economic value. When mangoes were first imported to the American colonies in
    the 17th century, they had to be pickled because of lack of refrigeration. Other fruits were also pickled and came
    to be called "mangoes", especially bell peppers, and in the 18th century, the word "mango" became a verb meaning "to
    pickle".

    Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or
    information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of
    information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an
    information system, a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all
    hardware, software and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of users.<br>
    Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia
    developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a
    1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented
    that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)."
    Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and
    mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.
    <img src="./img/global-computer-network1.jpg" class="image3" alt="img of global-computer-network"
      style="width:420px;height:250px;margin:15px;">
    The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other
    information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an
    economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics,
    semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.<br>
    Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT
    development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and
    electronic (1940–present).
  </p>
  <p>In this example, the image also is displayed just where it has occured (in the middle of the text) with the
    property 'float: none;'</p>

  <h1>The clear Property</h1>

  <h2>The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared
    element and on which side.</h2>

  <p>The most common way to use the clear property is after you have used a float property on an element.</p>

  <ol class="clear-props">The clear property can have one of the following values:</ol>
  <li>none - Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default</li>
  <li>left - No floating elements allowed on the left side</li>
  <li>right- No floating elements allowed on the right side</li>
  <li>both - No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side</li>
  <li>inherit - The element inherits the clear value of its parent</li>

  <p>When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you
    should clear to the left.</p>

  <h3>div2 is without clear</h3>
  <div class="div1">div1</div>
  <div class="div2">div2<br>
    Notice that div2 is after div1 in the HTML code. However, since div1 floats to the left,
    the text in div2 flows around div1.<br>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi
    lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor.</div>
  <br>
  <h3>div4 is with clear:left</h3>
  <div class="div3">div3</div>
  <div class="div4">div4<br>
    Here, div4 is clear: left; moves div4 down below the floating div3. The value "left" clears
    elements floated to the left.<br>
    If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left.
  </div>

  <h3>div12 is without clear </h3>
  <div class="div11">div11</div>
  <div class="div12">div12<br>
    Here, the div12 is after div11 in the HTML code and since div11 floats to the right,
    the text in div12 flows around div11.
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi
    lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum
    interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio.
  </div>

  <h3>div9 is with clear: right</h3>
  <div class="div9">div9<br>
    Here, div9 is clear: right; allows div9 to be above the floating div8. The value "right" clears
    elements floated to the right - means that no floating elements are allowed on the right side (of the div9)<br>
  </div>
  <div class="div8">div8</div>

  <h3>div7 is with clear: both</h3>
  <div class="div3">div3</div>
  <div class="div7">div7<br>
    You can also clear 'right' or 'left' or 'both'. Here, div7 is clear: both but since div3 has float: left, it
    moves div7 down below the floating div3.
  </div>

  <h2>Отже</h2>
  <p>Властивість <b>clear</b> встановлює, з якого боку елемента заборонено його обтікання іншими елементами.</p>
  <p>Іншими словами, властивість визначає чи елемент має бути розміщений поруч із пливучим елементом (властивість
    clear:none або без вказання узагалі властивості clear) чи переміщений донизу/доверху властивість clear: left чи
    clear: right.</p>
  <p>Ви можете вказати сторону (або обидві - властивість clear: both), з якої елемент не буде обтікатися іншими.</p>
  <p>Якщо застосувати властивість для непливучого елементу, він переміщується донизу, доки його межа не буде нижча за
    межі верхнього пливучого елементу. Під час цього переміщення не відбувається ефект об'єднання відступів(margin).<br>
    Якщо застосувати властивість для пливучого елементу, його поведінка схожа, з попереднім прикладом, але у цьому
    випадку наступні пливучі елементи, які розміщені нижче сторінкою, не можуть бути розміщені вище за попередні.</p>

  <p>У першому прикладі нижче ми не вказували жодної властивості <b>clear</b> для сірого блоку (непливучий елемент) тим
    самим дозволивши його контенту обтікати чорний блок з правої сторони</p>

  </div>
  <p>У другому прикладі за допомогою властивості <b>clear:right</b> ми відмінили обтікання контенту
    сірого блоку з правої сторони і перемістили сам блок донизу</p>
  <div class="block two">
