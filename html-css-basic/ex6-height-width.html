  <h1>CSS Height and Width</h1>
  <p>The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.</p>
  <p>The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins.<br>
    It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.
  </p>

  <p>The height and width properties may have the following values:<br>
    - auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width<br>
    - length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc.<br>
    - % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block<br>
    - initial - Sets the height/width to its default value<br>
    - inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value
  </p>

  <div class="ex1">This div element has a height of 200px and a width of 50%:</div>
  <br>

  <div class="ex2">This div element has a height of 100px and a width of 400px:</div>

  <p>Note: Remember that the height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins! They set the
    height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!</p>

  <h2>Setting max-width</h2>
  <p>The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.</p>
  <p>The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or
    set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).</p>

  <p>The problem with the div above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px).<br>
    The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.<br>
    Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.<br>
    Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!
  </p>
  <p>Note: The value of the max-width property overrides width.</p>

  <p>Set the max-width and min-width of an element</p>

  <div class="ex3">This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
  </div>

  <p>Set the max-height and min-height of an element</p>
  <div class="ex4">This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
  </div>

  <h2>Using width, max-width and margin: auto;</h2>
  <p>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it
    can).</p>

  <p>Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then,
    you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up
    the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins
  </p>

  <div class="ex5">This div element has width: 500px;</div>
  <br>

  <div class="ex6">This div element has max-width: 500px;</div>

  <p>Note: The problem with the div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. The
    browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.</p>

  <p>Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important
    when making a site usable on small devices:</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between
    the two divs!</p>
