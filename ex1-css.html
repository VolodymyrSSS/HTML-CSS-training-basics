  <h1>Hello World!<h1>
  <h1>CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document</h1>
  <h2>CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</h2>
  <p>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets<br>
    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media<br>
    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once<br>
    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
  </p>

  <h2>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design,<br> 
    layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
  </h2>

  <p>
    HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!<br>
    <br>
    HTML was created to <b>describe the content</b> of a web page, like:<br>
    <br>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a subheading - The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph styled with CSS - With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p><br>
    This is a paragraph without CSS:<br>
    When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers.<br>
    Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.<br>
    <br>
    To solve this problem, the <b>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</b> created CSS.<br>
    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!<br>
