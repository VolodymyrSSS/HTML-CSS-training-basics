  <h1>CSS Selectors<h1>

      <h2>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute,
        and more.</h2>

      <p>The element Selector - selects elements based on the element name<br>
        You can select all para elements on a page like this (in this case, all para elements will be placed left, with
        a blue text color)</p>

      <h2>The id Selector</h2>

      <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element<br>
        <p id="para1">The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one
          unique element!</p>
        <p>To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element</p>

        <h2>The class Selector</h2>

        <p>The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.<br>
          To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class<br>
          In the example below, all HTML elements with class="center" will be brown and center-aligned
        </p>
        <p class="center">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Omnis nostrum eius laudantium,
          doloribus odio, consequatur animi quod, accusamus rerum laborum similique quis. Sunt animi perferendis odio
          sint minima id obcaecati.Nobis magnam sit voluptatem, rerum quo maiores vel impedit, adipisci placeat officia
          hic delectus saepe quas ab aut. Eligendi quae?</p>
        <p>You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class<br>
          In the example below, only para elements with class="right" will be brown and right-aligned
        </p>
        <p class="right">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Omnis nostrum eius laudantium,
          doloribus odio?</p>
        <p>HTML elements can also refer to more than one class<br>
          In the example below, the para element will be styled according to class="right" and to class="large"
        </p>
        <p class="right large">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>

        <h2>Grouping Selectors</h2>

        <p>If you have elements with the same style definitions it will be better to group the selectors, to minimize
          the code<br>
          To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma
        </p>
        <h3>Lorem111 ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</h3>
        <p class="standart">Lorem222 ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
        <p class="standart">Lorem333 ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>

        <h2>CSS Comments</h2>
        <p>Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date<br>
          Comments are ignored by browsers and not shown in the output<br>
          A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can also span multiple lines
        </p>
